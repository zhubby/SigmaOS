# Agent Instructions

These instructions apply to the whole repository. `CLAUDE.md` contains the
short Claude-specific handoff; this file is the project source of truth.

## Project And Runtime

SigmaOS is a TypeScript npm-workspaces monorepo for a single-user Linux NAS
appliance. It is deployed as native Node.js processes and systemd units, not as
a Docker container.

- `apps/web`: React/Vite web UI.
- `apps/api`: Fastify API, WebSocket/SSE endpoints, and production static files.
- `apps/worker`: agent job worker.
- `apps/indexer`: SQLite/FTS NAS indexer.
- `apps/scheduler`: scheduled maintenance, backup, and health jobs.
- `apps/backup`, `apps/hostd`, `apps/termux`: backup and host
  integration processes.
- `packages/db`, `packages/nas-tools`, `packages/agent`, `packages/shared`:
  persistence, path-safe filesystem operations, agent routing, and shared
  configuration/types.
- `docs`: Astro/Starlight documentation site and Playwright smoke tests.
- `scripts`: build metadata, version policy, and release preparation.
- `packaging`: Debian rules, systemd units, Nginx config, host installer, and
  appliance rootfs builder.
- `.github/workflows/package-release.yml`: CI quality, package, browser smoke,
  and tagged release workflow.

Node.js 22 (the documented minimum is 22.12+) and npm are required for local
development and CI. Production packages support Debian-family `amd64` and
`arm64`; native modules such as `better-sqlite3` and Rust daemons must be built
for the target architecture.

## Working Tree And Scope

- Run `git status --short` before editing. Preserve existing user changes,
  including changes in files that are not part of the request.
- Keep edits scoped to the requested behavior and follow local patterns before
  introducing abstractions or dependencies.
- Do not rewrite history, reset files, or run destructive commands unless the
  user explicitly asks.
- Do not commit or push unless asked. Never add generated output such as
  `node_modules`, `dist`, coverage, logs, `.sigmaos` build artifacts, or
  `docs/.astro`/`docs/test-results`.
- Keep TypeScript strict; do not weaken compiler settings or use `any` to hide
  type errors.

## Install And Development

Install both workspace and documentation dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm --prefix docs ci
# convenience target (root npm install + docs npm ci):
make install
```

Use an isolated development data directory so local processes cannot read or
mutate production NAS paths:

```bash
mkdir -p .sigmaos/dev-data/nas
SIGMAOS_ENVIRONMENT=development \
SIGMAOS_DATA_DIR="$PWD/.sigmaos/dev-data" \
SIGMAOS_NAS_ROOTS="dev:Development NAS:$PWD/.sigmaos/dev-data/nas" \
SIGMAOS_ENABLE_LOCAL_AGENT_FALLBACK=1 \
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts the API, worker, and web Vite server. The indexer and
scheduler are intentionally separate processes:

```bash
npm run index                 # one index pass
npm run schedule              # scheduler process
npm run maintenance           # one maintenance pass
npm run docs:dev              # documentation site on 127.0.0.1:4321
```

The default development endpoints are Web `127.0.0.1:5173`, API
`127.0.0.1:3010`, and docs `127.0.0.1:4321/docs/`.

## Verification And Tests

Run the narrowest useful check while iterating, then the full gate before
handing off substantive changes:

```bash
npm run typecheck             # tsc plus Astro docs check
npm run lint                  # ESLint over the repository
npm test                      # Vitest plus docs metadata/content tests
npm run build                 # build metadata, all workspaces, and docs

make check                    # typecheck + lint + test
make ci                       # make check + build
```

The root Vitest config runs tests under `packages/**`, `apps/**`,
`packaging/**`, and `scripts/**` in a Node environment with a threaded pool.
The test suite includes API contracts, path/traversal safety, database/schema,
worker/indexer/scheduler behavior, web components, packaging declarations, and
build/version scripts. Add focused tests for behavior changes; preserve the
wire shapes of `/api/files/meta` and `/api/files/text` with tests when touching
file routes.

Documentation browser smoke is a separate check and is not included in
`npm test` or `make ci`:

```bash
npm run docs:build
npm --prefix docs exec -- playwright install --with-deps chromium  # once per host/CI image
npm run docs:browser
```

The smoke suite serves the built `docs/dist` and checks navigation/search,
Mermaid rendering, and a 404 for unknown documentation routes. Frontend,
packaging, or build-configuration changes require `npm run build`; UI changes
should also receive a browser check when practical.

Before a release or package build, run `npm run version:check`. The GitHub
workflow runs on pull requests, pushes to `main`, and `v*` tags. Its quality
job uses Node 22 and runs version check, typecheck, lint, test, and build. The
package job then builds and validates one `.deb`, `.changes`, and `.buildinfo`
artifact for each of `amd64` and `arm64`. The docs-browser job separately
installs Chromium and runs the Playwright smoke suite. Tagged releases also
require the tag to be reachable from `main` and to match the Debian changelog.

## Deployment And Packaging

### Debian package

Build on the target architecture when possible. `build-deb.sh` copies the
checkout to `.sigmaos/deb-build`, runs the Debian rules (fresh root/docs npm
installs, full build, and `npm test`), and writes package artifacts under
`.sigmaos/`:

```bash
SIGMAOS_NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com \
  ./packaging/scripts/build-deb.sh
# or: make deb
```

The package contains compiled app/docs assets, bundled workspace `node_modules`,
build metadata, `/etc/sigmaos` defaults, and systemd units. It does not start
services during `dpkg` installation; the host installer performs first boot
and service activation.

### Host installer

`packaging/scripts/install.sh` is a host-mutating operation. It must run as
root on Debian-family `amd64`/`arm64`. The terminal identity is always `sigmaos`:

```bash
sudo SIGMAOS_NAS_ROOT_PATH=/srv/nas \
  ./packaging/scripts/install.sh
```

The script can install/verify Node.js 22, configure and back up known APT
sources under `/var/backups/sigmaos-apt`, build/install the current checkout,
initialize `/etc/sigmaos/config.toml` and `/var/lib/sigmaos`, and configure
Nginx. `SIGMAOS_ENABLE_NGINX` defaults to `1`; Docker and VM support default to
`0` and can be enabled explicitly with `SIGMAOS_ENABLE_DOCKER=1` and
`SIGMAOS_ENABLE_VM=1`. Review `SIGMAOS_APT_*`, `SIGMAOS_NODE_*`, and
`SIGMAOS_NPM_REGISTRY` before using internal or domestic mirrors.

After installation, core services are enabled and started; indexer,
scheduler, maintenance, health, and backup timers are enabled but do not all
run immediately. Nginx proxies the loopback API (`127.0.0.1:3010`) and serves
the LAN entrypoint (default port 80).

### Appliance rootfs

`packaging/appliance/build-image.sh` creates a systemd rootfs tarball, not a
flashable SD/eMMC image. It requires `node`, `mmdebstrap`, `systemd-nspawn`,
`tar`, `curl`, and `sha256sum`, and consumes a previously built `.deb`:

```bash
SIGMAOS_DEB="$PWD/.sigmaos/sigmaos_<version>_arm64.deb" \
SIGMAOS_IMAGE_OUT="$PWD/.sigmaos/appliance" \
SIGMAOS_TARGET_ARCH=arm64 \
  ./packaging/appliance/build-image.sh
# or: make appliance (when the default .deb path is present)
```

Defaults are Debian bookworm, `arm64`, and `.sigmaos/appliance`. The output is
`.sigmaos/appliance/sigmaos-rootfs-<arch>.tar`; board-specific boot, network,
mount, and first-boot configuration remain outside this script. Docker, VM,
and backup are disabled by the generated first-boot defaults and must be
enabled/configured deliberately.

### Post-deploy checks and operations

Use service status and journald, not only a single liveness request:

```bash
sudo systemctl --failed
sudo systemctl is-active sigmaos-api.service sigmaos-worker@1.service \
  sigmaos-termux.service sigmaos-hostd.service
sudo systemctl list-timers 'sigmaos-*'
sudo journalctl -u sigmaos-api.service -u sigmaos-worker@1.service -n 100 --no-pager
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3010/health
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/roots/readiness
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/system/health
```

`/health` is API liveness only; it does not prove NAS mounts, indexing, or
backup readiness. Oneshot units normally return to `inactive (dead)` after
success, so inspect their exit code and journal. Manually run a task with its
service, for example `sudo systemctl start sigmaos-indexer.service`, rather
than invoking a timer directly. After changing units or configuration, run
`sudo systemctl daemon-reload` and restart affected resident services.

For upgrades, stop all indexer/scheduler/maintenance/health/backup timers,
save the current `.deb`, `/etc/sigmaos`, `/var/lib/sigmaos` and SQLite state,
install the new package, and re-run the API, readiness, index, health, and
backup acceptance checks before re-enabling timers. Database migrations have no
general reverse migration; a downgrade may require restoring a matching state
backup as well as the old package.

## Safety Boundaries

- Keep all NAS reads/writes inside configured NAS roots. Preserve traversal,
  symlink, mount-readiness, and path normalization protections.
- Mutating file operations and agent actions remain approval-gated. Do not add
  a bypass or broaden the local fallback without explicit product direction.
- Keep API response contracts stable unless an API change is explicitly
  requested and tested.
- SQLite is shared by API, worker, indexer, scheduler, and backup; avoid
  concurrent ad-hoc writers and consider migration/backfill safety for schema
  changes.
- Production API binds to loopback. Use the packaged Nginx proxy for LAN access;
  do not expose the unauthenticated local-only API directly to the internet.
- Keep systemd hardening and service identities intact. `hostd` is the
  constrained root helper; other runtime services should remain non-root.

## Frontend And UI

Match the existing dark, dense, utility-focused UI. Reuse local components,
CSS variables, and `lucide-react` icons. Keep layouts stable across desktop and
mobile, avoid text overlap, keep user-facing copy short and operational, and
verify preview/file-browser changes in a browser when practical.

The normative frontend design language is documented in
`docs/src/content/docs/reference/frontend-design.md`. Read and follow it before
making UI changes. Update that document when intentionally changing shared
visual tokens, layout breakpoints, interaction semantics, or responsive
information architecture; do not introduce page-local design rules that
contradict it.

## Git

Stage only files relevant to the request. Do not commit generated output.
Commit, tag, push, or create a release only when the user explicitly asks.
