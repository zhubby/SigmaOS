## Code Review Results

**Scope:** `359be23` to the current working tree, including the Rust VOD player, API/Web contracts, configuration migration, systemd packaging, and documentation.

**Intent:** Completely replace the Node `player-helper` with the Rust `sigmaos-vod-player` service, rename all public surfaces to VOD Player, remove the legacy runtime and API, and add crash, restart, storage, device, and mpv recovery without reopening path-based TOCTOU windows.

**Mode:** autofix; sequential main-thread fallback required by repository instructions.

**Reviewers:** correctness, testing, maintainability, project standards, agent-native, learnings, security, performance, API contract, reliability, adversarial, TypeScript, and deployment verification.

### Findings

No actionable code findings remain after the autofix review.

### Applied Fixes

- Moved controller shutdown onto a dedicated high-priority watch signal so a saturated command queue cannot block service termination.
- Deduplicated recovery scheduling across mpv IPC EOF, `end-file`, and child exit notifications, preventing one failure from incrementing the retry counter multiple times.
- Classified transient startup I/O failures as recoverable while keeping deterministic codec and media failures terminal.
- Stabilized mpv, DRM, and ALSA permission failures as `PERMISSION_DENIED` and HTTP 403.
- Made corrupt-session quarantine best effort so an unwritable diagnostic rename cannot prevent the daemon from starting idle.
- Added `SIGMAOS_NAS_ROOTS` parity with the API and explicit duplicate/missing root validation.
- Rejected socket and state paths under `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` across Rust, TypeScript, and refresh tooling to preserve visibility with `PrivateTmp=yes`.
- Hardened the refresh script for spaced TOML section syntax and single- or double-quoted values.
- Added shared Unix broker client coverage and a fake-mpv command-timeout integration case.
- Documented the persistent socket/state path constraints and the old-service upgrade shutdown sequence.

### Requirements Completeness

- Met: the Node `apps/player-helper` runtime, package entry, protocol, route, and systemd unit are removed; the workspace now builds `sigmaos-vod-player` from `apps/vod-player`.
- Met: the daemon uses a controller actor, bounded VOD Player Protocol v1 broker, peer credential checks, private mpv socketpair, correlated command responses, startup/command timeouts, structured errors, watchdog notifications, and bounded stderr diagnostics.
- Met: local media is resolved through mount metadata and `openat2`, validated as a regular file, and handed to mpv by inherited `fdclose://` descriptor rather than reopened by pathname.
- Met: durable session checkpoints, identity revalidation, playing/paused restart behavior, retry backoff, stable state revisions, clean child termination, and automatic mpv/storage/device recovery are implemented.
- Met: new `/api/vod-player/*` routes, session conflict handling, health integration, shared types/client, responsive Web controls, VOD configuration names, config migration, Debian scripts, and `sigmaos-vod-player.service` replace the legacy surfaces without aliases.
- Met locally: Rust unit and fake-mpv integration coverage, TypeScript contracts, configuration/packaging tests, responsive browser checks, full repository CI, and Linux `amd64`/`arm64` target checks.
- Release validation required: build/install the real Debian package, exercise systemd notify/watchdog and sandboxing, validate DRM/ALSA hotplug and hardware decoding, detach/reattach a physical NAS pool, and force daemon/mpv/system failure at persistence boundaries.

### Residual Actionable Work

None in the source tree. The remaining work is release-owned Linux and target-hardware acceptance.

### Learnings & Past Solutions

- No applicable repository solution notes were found under `docs/solutions/`.

### Agent-Native Gaps

None. Status and every supported playback command remain available through the same versioned broker and public API used by the Web UI.

### Deployment Notes

- Before upgrade, back up `/etc/sigmaos`, `/var/lib/sigmaos`, and the current package; stop and disable `sigmaos-player-helper.service` before enabling `sigmaos-vod-player.service`.
- Run `sigmaos-vod-player migrate-config` during package configuration and retain `.pre-vod-player.bak`; conflicting old/new configuration must remain a hard failure rather than being overwritten.
- Verify the new unit's readiness/watchdog state, `/api/vod-player/status`, and `/api/system/health`, then exercise resume after service and system restart.
- Validate mpv crash/hang recovery, HDMI and audio hotplug, NAS detach/reattach, file replacement rejection, and session conflict behavior on the target appliance.
- Rollback requires restoring the pre-migration configuration backup; an in-progress Node playback session is intentionally not migrated.

### Coverage

- Suppressed findings: 0; dropped malformed findings: 0; failed reviewers: 0.
- `make ci` passed on the final source tree, covering TypeScript/Astro checks, ESLint, Rust formatting and clippy, Rust/Vitest/docs tests, and production builds.
- `sigmaos-vod-player`: 30 Rust tests passed, including fake-mpv command correlation, timeout, state, storage, protocol, config migration, and persistence behavior.
- `cargo check --workspace` passed for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`.
- Browser checks passed for the main application at 1280, 820, 560, 390, and 320 px and for VOD busy, recovering, and long-error states at 1280, 560, 390, and 320 px, with no horizontal overflow or console errors.
- A real Debian package was not built or installed on this macOS host; systemd, DRM/ALSA, physical NAS, power-loss, and target hardware checks remain release gates.

---

> **Verdict:** Ready for Linux release acceptance.
>
> **Reasoning:** No confirmed source-level findings remain, the complete local CI and both Linux target checks pass, and the high-risk IPC, path resolution, recovery, persistence, API, UI, and upgrade paths have focused coverage. The remaining checks require a Debian/systemd appliance with real storage and media devices.
