# Code Review Results

**Scope:** Docker daemon status and configuration implementation against base `e07a3a2b7f30d6485d7c1335eab89bda30d2a8c8` (25 task files)
**Intent:** Expose live `docker.service` state, safely edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json` through the privileged helper, restart with rollback, and provide a localized responsive management dialog.
**Mode:** autofix

**Reviewers:** correctness, testing, maintainability, project-standards, agent-native, learnings, security, api-contract, reliability, adversarial, kieran-typescript, frontend-races
- security -- adds a privileged root helper operation and handles daemon configuration that may contain credentials
- api-contract -- adds REST, SSE, and shared public types
- reliability -- adds polling, restart, rollback, and recovery state
- adversarial -- the diff spans more than 1,000 lines and crosses privileged, API, UI, packaging, and operational boundaries
- kieran-typescript -- adds TypeScript services, routes, React state, and validation helpers
- frontend-races -- adds EventSource, timer, dialog, and async submission lifecycles

### P1 -- High

| # | File | Issue | Reviewer | Confidence | Route |
|---|------|-------|----------|------------|-------|
| 1 | `apps/share-helper/src/helper.ts` | External edits made during validation or restart could be overwritten by save or rollback | correctness, security, reliability, adversarial | 0.98 | `safe_auto -> review-fixer` |
| 2 | `packaging/debian/postinst` | Package upgrades recursively changed daemon recovery material to the unprivileged `sigmaos` owner | security, project-standards | 0.96 | `safe_auto -> review-fixer` |

### P2 -- Moderate

| # | File | Issue | Reviewer | Confidence | Route |
|---|------|-------|----------|------------|-------|
| 3 | `apps/api/src/routes/docker.ts` | SSE initial delivery, change deduplication, heartbeat, and close cleanup lacked automated coverage | testing, reliability, frontend-races | 0.97 | `safe_auto -> review-fixer` |
| 4 | `apps/api/src/lib/docker-daemon.ts` | API revision validation and systemd `reloading` normalization were inconsistent with the helper and running service semantics | correctness, api-contract | 0.90 | `safe_auto -> review-fixer` |

### Requirements Completeness

- [x] Shared daemon status and configuration contracts
- [x] Fixed-path privileged helper boundary, validation, atomic writes, and serialized updates
- [x] Revision conflicts, pending baseline, restart, rollback, and retained recovery material
- [x] REST configuration API and live SSE status stream
- [x] Daemon state remains independent from Docker Engine socket readiness
- [x] Localized settings dialog, confirmation flow, disabled states, and reconnecting state
- [x] Systemd packaging permissions and root-only recovery state
- [x] Operations, helper, API, and troubleshooting documentation
- [x] Focused tests, full CI gate, and desktop/520px browser verification

### Applied Fixes

- Added revision checks after dockerd validation, immediately before atomic rename, before restart, and before rollback replacement.
- Preserved external edits and retained recovery material when rollback cannot safely replace the pending file.
- Restored `/var/lib/sigmaos/docker-daemon` to `0700 root:root` after package state ownership changes.
- Extracted the SSE stream lifecycle into a testable function and covered initial state, deduplication, heartbeat, and close cleanup.
- Added API revision-shape validation, helper-unavailable redaction coverage, and `reloading` normalization.

### Learnings & Past Solutions

- No `docs/solutions/` directory or matching prior solution was present in this repository.

### Coverage

- Suppressed: 0 findings below the confidence threshold.
- Residual actionable work: none.
- Residual risk: each connected SSE client performs its own one-second systemd sample; this is acceptable for the single-user appliance scope but would need a shared broadcaster if connection counts grow materially.
- Testing gaps: privileged `dockerd` validation and `systemctl restart` are covered with deterministic runners; final host integration still requires the real Linux helper and Docker service during deployment.
- Failed reviewers: none; project instructions required sequential main-thread review rather than sub-agents.

---

> **Verdict:** Ready to merge
>
> **Reasoning:** All explicit requirements are implemented, all concrete review findings were fixed, `make ci` passes, and desktop plus 520px browser checks show no overlap or overflow.
