## Code Review Results

**Scope:** `f2033b0e58eb27f09d07b2be89d6737d21339b2c` to the current working tree (81 tracked changes and 37 pre-review untracked files). The 35 untracked implementation files for the Rust crate, IPC client, systemd unit, Cargo workspace, and toolchain were explicitly included; the other two files are the preserved earlier review artifact.

**Intent:** Completely replace the privileged Node `share-helper` runtime with the Rust `sigmaos-hostd` daemon, rename its service, socket, environment, and configuration surfaces, preserve host-management behavior, and provide production-grade validation, rollback, packaging, upgrade migration, and test coverage.

**Mode:** autofix; sequential main-thread fallback required by repository instructions. This final pass found no new safe-auto issues, so it made no code changes.

**Reviewers:** correctness, testing, maintainability, project standards, agent-native, learnings, security, performance, API contract, data migration, reliability, adversarial, TypeScript, CLI readiness, schema drift, and deployment verification.

### Findings

No actionable findings remain after the final review. The earlier review at `20260921-093725-rust-hostd` is retained as historical evidence but is superseded by this report.

### Resolved Since Previous Review

- Limited IPC handling to 64 concurrent connections and added a five-second response-write deadline.
- Rejected non-UTF-8 paths, newlines, and control characters before embedding share paths in service configuration.
- Created temporary files with their final restrictive permissions, applied ownership before file `fsync`, then atomically renamed and synchronized the parent directory.
- Restricted mdadm array paths so ordinary devices such as `/dev/sda` cannot be presented as arrays.
- Queried `mdadm --detail --export` before RAID deletion and rejected stale requested member lists before changing fstab or unmounting.
- Added HostdClient coverage for request and response limits, multiple response frames, request timeout, and Unix socket error codes.
- Refreshed disabled share services with `try-reload-or-restart`, closing the stale-protocol risk noted in the earlier report.

### Residual Actionable Work

None. The remaining items are architecture or release-validation risks rather than code defects suitable for an automatic change.

### Learnings & Past Solutions

- No applicable repository solution notes were found under `docs/solutions/`.

### Agent-Native Gaps

None. Hostd is an internal privilege boundary; users and agents continue to reach every supported action through the existing API and approval workflows.

### Schema Drift Check

- Clean: migration `016_hostd_config` only removes the retired `helperSocketPath` JSON field and introduces no unrelated schema objects.

### Deployment Notes

- Pre-deploy: back up the current package, `/etc/sigmaos`, `/var/lib/sigmaos`, and SQLite state; keep all writer services and timers stopped during the upgrade.
- Upgrade: install the new package, verify `config.toml.pre-hostd.bak`, confirm `[hostd].socket_path`, and confirm `sigmaos-share-helper.service` is disabled while `sigmaos-hostd.service` is enabled.
- Healthy signals: `sigmaos-hostd.service` and `sigmaos-api.service` stay active, `/health`, `/api/roots/readiness`, and `/api/system/health` succeed, and representative approved share, storage, Docker, and NetworkManager operations complete without rollback errors.
- Failure signals: hostd restart loops, peer-credential or socket permission errors, migration failures, `restart_failed`, `operation_failed`, or `rollback: failed`. Stop rollout and restore the matching package, configuration, and state backup together.
- Validation window and owner: the appliance operator should monitor hostd/API journals and service restart counters through the upgrade maintenance window and the first scheduled job cycle.

### Coverage

- Suppressed: 0 findings below the confidence threshold; dropped malformed findings: 0; failed reviewers: 0.
- `make ci` passed on the final tree: TypeScript/Astro typecheck, Rustfmt, Clippy with `-D warnings`, ESLint, 61 Rust tests, the complete Vitest/docs test suite, Rust release build, web build, docs build, and internal-link validation.
- The six focused `HostdClient` tests passed independently.
- `npm run version:check` passed at `0.6.0`; `git diff --check` and `cargo fmt --all --check` passed.
- The macOS review host does not provide `dpkg-buildpackage` or `systemd-analyze`, so a real Debian package install, systemd sandbox validation, and privileged mdadm/mount/NetworkManager/Docker acceptance remain Linux release gates.
- Architecture risk: API, worker, and other services share the `sigmaos` UID accepted by hostd. A compromised peer process could invoke the hostd protocol directly; separating service identities or introducing a capability-scoped broker requires an explicit architecture decision.
- Cancellation risk: an API timeout closes the client socket but does not cancel a multi-command hostd operation already in progress. A cancellable operation protocol would be a separate contract change.
- Installer supply-chain risk: the host installer downloads and executes the configured rustup bootstrap script over HTTPS without pinning its checksum.
- Expected non-blocking output remains limited to the repository's existing React i18next test notice and Vite large-chunk warning.

---

> **Verdict:** Ready to merge; Linux package and appliance acceptance remain release gates.
>
> **Reasoning:** The final source tree has no remaining confirmed code findings, all local quality gates pass, and the latest security, persistence, IPC, RAID, migration, packaging, and client-edge-case fixes are covered. The remaining risks require deployment validation or separate architecture decisions rather than additional changes in this replacement.
